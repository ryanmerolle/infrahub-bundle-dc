# Infrahub API server address
# Used by CLI tools and local scripts to connect to Infrahub
# Note: The Service Catalog container uses http://infrahub-server:8000 automatically
# via docker-compose.override.yml for proper Docker networking
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8000

# Infrahub UI URL for browser links
# Used by the Service Catalog to generate clickable links to Infrahub UI pages
# Should be the URL accessible from your browser (typically http://localhost:8000)
export INFRAHUB_UI_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Infrahub API authentication token
# Generate a token in the Infrahub UI under Settings > API Tokens
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN=06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec

# Infrahub version to use
# Specify the version of Infrahub to run (e.g., 1.5.1, stable, latest)
export INFRAHUB_VERSION=1.5.2

# Enable Infrahub Enterprise features
# Set to "true" to enable enterprise features, "false" for community edition
export INFRAHUB_ENTERPRISE=false

# Use local git repository instead of GitHub
# Set to "true" to mount the current directory as the git repository in Infrahub
# This is useful for local development and testing of generator/transform changes
# When enabled:
#   - Infrahub will use /upstream (the mounted current directory) as the repo
#   - Bootstrap script loads objects/git-repo/local-dev.yml
# When disabled (default):
#   - Infrahub will clone from GitHub
#   - Bootstrap script loads objects/git-repo/github.yml
export INFRAHUB_GIT_LOCAL=false

# =============================================================================
# Service Catalog Configuration
# =============================================================================

# Enable the Service Catalog Streamlit application
# Set to "true" to start the service catalog container with 'uv run invoke start'
# Set to "false" (default) to run only the core Infrahub services
# The service catalog provides a web UI for managing data center deployments
export INFRAHUB_SERVICE_CATALOG=false

# Default branch to use when the service catalog application starts
# This is the branch that will be selected by default in the UI
export DEFAULT_BRANCH=main

# Time to wait (in seconds) for the Infrahub generator to complete after creating a DC
# Increase this value if your generators take longer to complete
export GENERATOR_WAIT_TIME=60

# API request timeout in seconds
# Maximum time to wait for API requests to complete
export API_TIMEOUT=30

# Number of retry attempts for failed API requests
# The service catalog will retry failed requests this many times before giving up
export API_RETRY_COUNT=3

# Streamlit server port (optional)
# Port on which the Streamlit application will run
# STREAMLIT_PORT=8501

# Additional Notes
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed
# 2. The .env file is gitignored and will not be committed to version control
# 3. For Docker Compose deployments, these variables can also be set in
#    docker-compose.override.yml under the environment section
# 4. Some variables (like INFRAHUB_ADDRESS) may need different values depending
#    on whether you're running locally or in Docker:
#    - Local development: http://localhost:8000
#    - Docker container: http://infrahub-server:8000
