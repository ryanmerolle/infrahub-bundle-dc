Create an Infrahub Proposed Change for reviewing branch changes before merging.

This script automates the creation of Proposed Changes in Infrahub, which provide
a controlled workflow for reviewing, validating, and approving infrastructure
changes before merging them to the main branch.

What is a Proposed Change?
==========================
A Proposed Change is Infrahub's change management mechanism that:
- Creates a review workflow for branch changes before merging to main
- Runs validation checks (generators, transforms, checks) on the proposed changes
- Provides a visual diff showing what will change when merged
- Allows team collaboration and approval before changes go live
- Generates artifacts (configs, topologies) for the proposed state
- Tracks the change lifecycle (open, merged, closed, canceled)

Why Use Proposed Changes?
==========================
1. **Risk Mitigation**: Review changes before they affect production
2. **Validation**: Automatically run checks to verify configuration correctness
3. **Collaboration**: Team members can review and approve changes
4. **Audit Trail**: Track who proposed and approved infrastructure changes
5. **Preview**: See generated configurations before applying changes
6. **Rollback**: Changes can be canceled if issues are discovered

Workflow Integration:
=====================
This script is typically used after creating a branch and loading demo data:
1. Create branch: `uv run infrahubctl branch create my-branch`
2. Load data: `uv run infrahubctl object load objects/dc/dc-arista-s.yml --branch my-branch`
3. Run generator: Via Infrahub UI or API to create topology
4. Create PC: `uv run python scripts/create_proposed_change.py --branch my-branch`
5. Review PC: Open the URL in browser to see validations and diffs
6. Merge PC: Approve and merge via Infrahub UI

Features:
=========
- Rich terminal UI with color-coded status indicators
- Automatic Infrahub connection and authentication
- Branch existence validation before creating Proposed Change
- Beautiful progress indicators during creation
- Detailed information table showing PC properties
- Direct URL link to view the Proposed Change in browser
- Helpful error messages with troubleshooting tips

Error Handling:
===============
- Validates Infrahub connectivity before proceeding
- Checks if branch exists (with graceful fallback)
- Detects duplicate Proposed Changes and provides helpful tips
- Clear error messages with remediation guidance

Usage:
======
    # Create proposed change for default branch (add-dc3)
    python scripts/create_proposed_change.py

    # Create proposed change for specific branch
    python scripts/create_proposed_change.py --branch my-feature-branch
    python scripts/create_proposed_change.py -b dc-juniper

    # Via invoke task (from tasks.py)
    uv run invoke create-pc --branch my-branch

Environment Variables:
======================
    INFRAHUB_ADDRESS: Infrahub server URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
    INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN: API token for authentication (if required)

Output:
=======
The script displays:
- Connection status with Infrahub server address
- Branch existence verification
- Creation progress with spinner animation
- Proposed Change details table (ID, Name, Source, Destination, State)
- Direct URL link to view in browser
- Success confirmation message

Exit Codes:
===========
    0: Proposed Change created successfully
    1: Failed to create (connection error, branch doesn't exist, duplicate PC, etc.)

async def create_proposed_change(branch: str) -> int:
    """
    Create an Infrahub Proposed Change from a branch to main.

    This function orchestrates the complete Proposed Change creation workflow:
    1. Display welcome panel with source/destination branch information
    2. Connect to Infrahub using SDK client with environment-based config
    3. Verify that the source branch exists in Infrahub
    4. Create the CoreProposedChange object via GraphQL mutation
    5. Display detailed information about the created Proposed Change
    6. Provide direct URL link to view in browser

    What Happens in Infrahub:
    ==========================
    When a Proposed Change is created, Infrahub automatically:
    - Creates a CoreProposedChange object with metadata
    - Initiates validation checks on the branch changes
    - Generates artifacts (configurations, topologies) for review
    - Prepares a visual diff of what will change when merged
    - Makes the PC available in the UI for team review

    Visual Feedback:
    ================
    - Welcome panel with branch names in color-coded format
    - Connection status with Infrahub server address
    - Branch verification status (with graceful fallback if unavailable)
    - Spinner animation during PC creation
    - Detailed table showing PC properties (ID, Name, Source, Destination, State)
    - Clickable URL to view the Proposed Change in browser
    - Success confirmation message

    Error Scenarios Handled:
    ========================
    1. Connection failure to Infrahub (network issues, wrong URL)
    2. Branch doesn't exist (user typo, branch not created yet)
    3. Duplicate Proposed Change (PC already exists for this branch)
    4. API errors during PC creation (permissions, validation failures)

    Args:
        branch: The source branch name to create a Proposed Change for.
               This branch will be compared against the main branch.
               The branch must exist in Infrahub before creating a PC.

    Returns:
        0 if Proposed Change created successfully
        1 if creation failed (connection error, branch missing, duplicate, etc.)

    Example:
        >>> # Create PC for a branch containing new DC topology
        >>> exit_code = await create_proposed_change("add-dc3")
        >>> if exit_code == 0:
        ...     print("Proposed Change ready for review!")

        >>> # Create PC for a feature branch
        >>> exit_code = await create_proposed_change("feature-new-security-zones")

    Note:
        The function uses environment variables for Infrahub connection:
        - INFRAHUB_ADDRESS: Server URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
        - INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN: Authentication token (if required)
